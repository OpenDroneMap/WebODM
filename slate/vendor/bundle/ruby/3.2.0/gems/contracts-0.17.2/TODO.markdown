- maybe make some screencasts

- you can now do something like Haskell's quickcheck. Every contract has a method 'test_data' or something. You can use that data to automatically check methods with contracts to make sure they are correct.

  - for stuff like the Not contract, should I make a standard set of classes to check those functions with? Would that be useful at all?
  - also write specs for this stuff
