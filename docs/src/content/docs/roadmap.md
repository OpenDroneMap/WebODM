title: Roadmap

While we don't have a formal roadmap, we follow a bottom-up approach to decide what new features are added to WebODM. User feedback guides us in the decision making process and we collect such feedback from the [community forum](https://community.opendronemap.org).

We keep track of which features are being considered for inclusion with the [issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM/issues)

Don't see a feature that you want? [Open a topic](https://community.opendronemap.org) or even better [a pull request](/contributing/).

Sometimes we also prioritize work that has received financial backing. If your organization is in the position to financially support the development of a particular feature, [get in touch](https://community.opendronemap.org) and we'll make it happen.
