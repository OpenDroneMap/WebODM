## Translations

It's easy to translate WebODM in a different language!

 - Visit https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/webodm/ and register an account (it's free)
 - Pick a language to translate, or [start a new translation](https://hosted.weblate.org/new-lang/webodm/webodm/)
 - Start translating! It's that easy.

If you want to preview your translation work, start WebODM in developer mode:

```
./webodm.sh restart --dev
```

Then edit the [LOCALES](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM/blob/master/LOCALES) file to include your translation locale code. Finally, visit the `Developer Tools` panel from WebODM's dashboard and press the `Download and Replace Translation Files` button:

The latest translation files from weblate.org will be downloaded and applied to the installation of WebODM.

## Become a Contributor

The easiest way to get started is to take a look at our list of [outstanding issues](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM/issues) and pick one. You can also fix/improve something entirely new based on your experience with WebODM. All ideas are considered and people of all skill levels are welcome to contribute.

You don't necessarily need to be a developer to become a contributor. We can use your help to write better documentation and improve the user interface texts and visuals.

If you know how to code, we primarily use Python (Django), Javascript (React), HTML and SCSS. See [Contributing](/contributing) for more information.

To make a contribution, you will need to open a pull request ([here's how](https://github.com/Roshanjossey/first-contributions#fork-this-repository)). To make changes to WebODM, make a clone of the repository and run `./webodm.sh start --dev`.

If you have questions visit us on the [forum](http://community.opendronemap.org/c/webodm) and we'll be happy to help you out with your first contribution.
