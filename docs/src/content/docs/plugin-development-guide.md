WebODM lets you write plugins, which you can distribute as .zip files or share them with the world by adding them to the `coreplugins` folder of WebODM (and opening a pull request). This is a flexible option for those that don't want to maintain a separate fork, yet want to add new functionalities to WebODM.

You can turn on/off plugins from the Dashboard via the **Administration** --> **Plugins** menu.

Plugins let you define both server-side (Python) and client-side logic (Javascript). They execute in a shared environment. There are hooks / event handlers / signals that you can subscribe to be notified of things, for example when a task is created/deleted, or when the map view is about to be rendered. There's a limited number of these, but keep in mind that more can be added.

Some basic helpers are provided, for example for running long asynchronous tasks, for doing basic key-value data storage, for installing isolated Python dependencies (via pip) as well as Javascript dependencies (via npm). A client side build system (via webpack) also lets you use React/SCSS in your plugin code and access all of WebODM's client side components (JSX).

You can make assets available (images, styles, templates, ...) simply by placing them in a `public` folder.

The plugin system doesn't try to impose strict standards. What you build is up to you and anything is possible.

## Quickstart

 * Make sure you have launched WebODM in development mode (via `--dev`). See [contributing](/contributing/#setup-a-development-environment) for instructions.
 * Go to **Administration** --> **Plugins** and activate the **Hello World** plugin.
 * Notice that a "Hello World" menu has appeared on the left-side menu.
 * Make a copy of the `coreplugins/hello-world` folder. Call it `coreplugins/my-plugin`.
 * Edit `coreplugins/my-plugin/manifest.json`:

 ```json
 {
	"name": "My Plugin",
	"webodmMinVersion": "2.9.4",
	"description": "My First plugin",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"author": "Your name",
	"email": "your@email.here",
	"repository": "https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM",
	"tags": ["descriptive", "tags"],
	"homepage": "https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM",
	"experimental": false,
	"deprecated": false
}
```

 * Edit `coreplugins/my-plugin/plugin.py`:

```python
from app.plugins import PluginBase, Menu, MountPoint
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.utils.translation import gettext as _

class Plugin(PluginBase):
    def main_menu(self):
        return [Menu(_("My Plugin"), self.public_url(""), "fa fa-cog fa-fw")]

    def app_mount_points(self):
        @login_required
        def hello_view(request):
            return render(request, self.template_path("hello.html"), {'message': "Hello!"})

        return [
            MountPoint('$', hello_view),
            # more mount points here ...
        ]
    
    def include_js_files(self):
        return ['main.js']
    
    def build_jsx_components(self):
        return ['app.jsx']

    # see also plugin_base.py for more methods
 ```

 * Save the changes and open `app/boot.py`, add an empty line, save the `boot.py`, then remove the empty line, then save `boot.py` again. This is a trick to force WebODM to reload without restarting the docker process. You only need to do this once.
 * Your plugin should be now visible under **Administration** --> **Plugins**.
 * Activate it to see if it works.

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You're now a plugin developer.

Your plugin should have this basic file structure:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ disabled
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json
â”œâ”€â”€ plugin.py
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ app.jsx
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ app.scss
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ main.js
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ webpack.config.js
â””â”€â”€ templates
    â””â”€â”€ hello.html
```

An empty `disabled` file in the root indicates that the plugin should not be enabled by default.

## Django Templates

You can render [Django templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/templates/) by placing template files in the `templates` folder. Then you render the templates by creating *mount points* (just like [Django URLs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/http/urls/)).

## Javascript Files

You can execute arbitrary javascript code. When your plugin is enabled, any file returned by `include_js_files` will be included in every WebODM page (in the header). You can use this as your entrypoint for loading more complex Javascript code (e.g. a React build) or for registering a hook.

## CSS Files

Same as for Javascript, you can include arbitrary CSS files via:


```python
def include_css_files(self):
    return ['style.css']
```

## React Components

If you plan to use React (optional) and want to use the built-in system for building the component (also optional), you'll need to declare which `.jsx` files you want to build via:

```python
def build_jsx_components(self):
    return ['app.jsx']
```

The built files will be placed in `coreplugins/my-plugin/public/build/*` and are accessible via `http://localhost:8000/plugins/my-plugin/build/*`.

If you use JSX components, you'll want to restart your development environment with:

```bash
./webodm.sh restart --dev --dev-watch-plugins
```

Otherwise you'll have to manually run `webpack --watch` from the `coreplugins/my-plugin/public` folder (inside the WebODM container).

On the client side, you can import your React components, as well as any other Javascript module, using various hooks. One of such hooks is the `PluginsAPI.App.Ready`, which is triggered on page load:

```javascript
PluginsAPI.App.ready([
        '/plugins/my-plugin/build/app.js',
        '/plugins/my-plugin/build/app.css'        
    ], function(args, App){
    
    ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(App, {greeting: "Hi"}), $("#hello-component").get(0));
});
```

## Client Side Hooks

You can be notified of various client side events via hooks. Some of these hooks allow you to return a DOM element, which can be useful for adding buttons, or other components at different times of the UI rendering process:

```javascript
PluginsAPI.hook([
    // optional list dependencies to load
], function(args, optional dependencies]){
    // Your code here

    // args contains parameters specific to each hook.

    console.log(args);

    var domEl = /* ... */;
    return domEl;
});

```

| <div style="width:260px">Hook</div>                            | Triggered                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `App.ready`                     | On DOM load                                                                                |
| `Dashboard.addTaskActionButton` | When buttons have been added to a task (next to View Map, View 3D Model, ..)             |
| `Dashboard.addNewTaskPanelItem` | When opening the panel after selecting images and GCPs                                    |
| `Dashboard.addNewTaskButton`    | When buttons have been added to a project's panel (next to Select Images and GCP, Import)|
| `Map.willAddControls`           | When Leaflet controls are about to be added                                                    |
| `Map.didAddControls`            | When Leaflet controls have been added                                                          |
| `Map.addActionButton`           | When action buttons (bottom right of the screen) are about to be added                    |
| `SharePopup.addLinkControl`     | When rendering the Share dialog in Map View                                               |

## Client Side Callbacks

Similar to hooks, callbacks can notify you of events happening around the application, but unlike hooks, they don't allow dependencies to be loaded. You can register and unregister callbacks:

```javascript
var myFunction = function(){
    return someValue;
};

PluginsAPI.[ns].onCallback(myFunction); // to register
PluginsAPI.[ns].offCallback(myFunction); // to unregister
```

For example:

```javascript
PluginsAPI.Map.onHandleClick(function(){
    console.log("Map clicked!");
});
```

| Namespace | <div style="width:260px">Callback</div> | Triggered When                                                                |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Map`     | `handleClick`                           | Leaflet map is clicked                                                        |
| `Map`     | `addAnnotation`                     | Annotation is about to be added                                               |                        
| `Map`     | `updateAnnotation`                  | Annotation is about to be changed                                             |                        
| `Map`     | `deleteAnnotation`                  | Annotation is about to be deleted                                             |                        
| `Map`     | `toggleAnnotation`                  | Annotation is about to be toggled                                             |                        
| `Map`     | `annotationDeleted`                 | Annotation has been deleted                                                   |                        
| `Map`     | `downloadAnnotations`               | A request to download annotations is initiated                                |                        
| `Map`     | `mapTypeChanged`                    | The map type (Orthophoto to Surface Model, to Plant Health, etc.) has changed |                        
| `Map`     | `sideBySideChanged`                 | The user has overlayed two layers side-by-side                                |                        

## Server Side Signals

You can register to various [Django signals](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/signals/) to be notified of events happening around the application.

```python
from django.dispatch import receiver
from app.plugins.signals import task_completed
from app.plugins.functions import get_current_plugin

@receiver(task_completed)
def on_complete(sender, task_id, **kwargs):
    # Don't execute this if the plugin is not active
    if get_current_plugin(only_active=True) is None:
        return
    
    print("Task %s has completed" % task_id)
```

| <div style="width:260px">Signal</div> | Triggered When                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `task_completed`                      | A task has finished successfully   |
| `task_removing`                       | A task is about to be deleted      |
| `task_removed`                        | A task has been deleted            |
| `task_failed`                         | A task has failed                  |
| `task_resizing_images`                | A task is resizing images          |
| `task_duplicated`                     | A task has been duplicated         |
| `processing_node_removed`             | A processing node has been deleted |

## NPM dependencies

You can use external dependencies by defining a `package.json` in the `public` folder of your plugin and reference those dependencies in your JSX components (or load them in the browser). This can be created via `npm init`. Dependencies are downloaded and installed automatically during build time.

## PIP dependencies

On the server side, you can install additional Python packages by defining a `requirements.txt` file in the root folder of your plugin (e.g. `coreplugins/myplugin/requirements.txt`).

When the plugin is enabled, the system will first check if any dependency needs to be downloaded and will run `pip install` if required.

In order to avoid versioning/namespacing collisions with WebODM, as well as with other plugins, to use a plugin dependency you need to wrap the import in a `python_imports` context: 

```python
from app.plugins.functions import get_current_plugin

with get_current_plugin().python_imports():
    import numpy as np
    # ...
```

## Long Running Tasks

The plugin system offers functions for performing long running server side tasks, as well as client side functions to track the status of such tasks. Long running tasks are executed by worker processes rather than the web server application.

On the server:

```python
from app.plugins.worker import run_function_async
from rest_framework import status
from rest_framework.response import Response

# From "/greet" a mount point

def long_greet(greeting, progress_callback=None):
    import time # You MUST place imports inside the async function and not at the top of the file
    time.sleep(30)
    progress_callback("Almost done!", 50) # optional (text status, [0-100]%)
    time.sleep(10)
    return greeting + " there!" # any JSON-serializable output

    # - or - you can also return files by returning a
    # myfile = 'path/to/file.txt'
    # return {'file': myfile}

try: 
    celery_task_id = run_function_async(long_greet, greeting="Hi").task_id
    return Response({'celery_task_id': celery_task_id}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
except Exception as e:
    return Response({'error': str(e)}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

On the client:

```javascript
import Workers from 'webodm/classes/Workers';

$.ajax({
    type: 'GET',
    url: `/api/plugins/myplugin/greet/`,
    contentType: "application/json"
}).done(res => {
    Workers.waitForCompletion(res.celery_task_id, error => {
        if (error){
            console.error("oh no!");
        }else{
            Workers.getOutput(result.celery_task_id, (error, greeting) => {
                console.log(greeting);
            });
            // - or - file downloads also
            // Workers.downloadFile(res.celery_task_id, res.filename);
        }
    }, (status, progress) => {
        console.log(status, progress)
    });
});
```

:::caution
You **must** declare all import statements inside your async functions (and not at the top of the file). You also can only pass JSON-serializable arguments to async functions. For example, you cannot pass complex Python objects.

## Built-in Data Store

Storing data is a frequent requirement for all kinds of applications, so the plugin system offers a simple key-value store for storing strings, integers, floats, booleans and JSON which can either be global (shared across all users) or user-based (specific to a user).

```python
from app.plugins import GlobalDataStore, UserDataStore

# from a mount point

ds = GlobalDataStore('myplugin')
uds = UserDataStore('myplugin', request.user)

ds.set_string("key1", "string")
ds.set_int("key2", 42)
ds.set_float("key3", 3.14)
ds.set_bool("key4", True)
ds.set_json("key5", {'piero_is': ['cool', 'silly', 'both']})

ds.get_string("key1")
ds.get_int("key2")

# ...
```

Data saved in this manner is stored **unencrypted** in the *PluginDatum* table. You can view/edit this data by visiting **Administration** --> **Application** --> **Plugin Datum**.

## Publishing Your Plugin

The easiest way to share your work is to open a pull request in the WebODM repository. At some point in the future we might create some sort of plugin repository where people can browse and download plugins, but we aren't quite there yet.

You can also create a zip file of the entire plugin folder (e.g. `myplugin`) with the folder as the top level entry in the zip archive and distribute the zip file manually. Users can then install the plugin by pressing the **Load Plugin (.zip)** button when visiting **Administration** --> **Plugins**.

## Final Tips

 * Learn from other plugins! This documentation provides the basics, but it really helps to study how other plugins work by looking at their source code.
 * If you need a new hook, callback or signal, open a pull request and let's add it into the system.
 * With time, this documentation might fall out of date. If something doesn't seem to match what you see in this page or doesn't seem to work, check the code! The plugin system is not complicated and can be read from start to finish in less than a few hours. Read `app/plugins` and `app/static/app/js/classes/plugins`.
 * Have fun :)
