WebODM lets you write plugins, which you can distribute as .zip packages or share them with the world by adding them to the `coreplugins` folder of WebODM (and opening a pull request). This is a flexible option for those that don't want to maintain a separate fork, yet want to add new functionalities to WebODM.

You can turn on/off plugins from the Dashboard via the **Administration** --> **Plugins** menu.

Plugins let you define both server-side (Python) and client-side logic (Javascript). They execute in a shared environment. There are hooks / event handlers that you can subscribe to be notified of things, for example when a task is created/deleted, or when the map view is about to be rendered. There's a limited number of hooks, but keep in mind that more can be added.

Some basic helpers are provided, for example for running asynchronous tasks (think long running), for doing basic key-value data storage, for installing isolated Python dependencies (via pip) as well as Javascript dependencies (via npm). A client side build system (via webpack) also lets you use React/SCSS in your plugin code and access all of WebODM's client side components (JSX).

You can make assets available (images, styles, templates, ...) simply by placing them in a `public` folder.

The plugin system doesn't try to impose strict standards. What you build is up to you and anything is possible.

## Quickstart

 * Make sure you have launched WebODM in development mode (via `--dev`). See [contributing](/contributing/#setup-a-development-environment) for instructions.
 * Go to **Administration** --> **Plugins** and activate the **Hello World** plugin.
 * Notice that a "Hello World" menu has appeared on the left-side menu.
 * Make a copy of the `coreplugins/hello-world` folder. Call it `coreplugins/my-plugin`.
 * Edit `coreplugins/my-plugin/manifest.json`:

 ```json
 {
	"name": "My Plugin",
	"webodmMinVersion": "2.9.4",
	"description": "My First plugin",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"author": "Your name",
	"email": "your@email.here",
	"repository": "https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM",
	"tags": ["descriptive", "tags"],
	"homepage": "https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM",
	"experimental": false,
	"deprecated": false
}
```

 * Edit `coreplugins/my-plugin/plugin.py`:

```python
from app.plugins import PluginBase, Menu, MountPoint
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.utils.translation import gettext as _

class Plugin(PluginBase):
    def main_menu(self):
        return [Menu(_("My Plugin"), self.public_url(""), "fa fa-cog fa-fw")]

    def app_mount_points(self):
        @login_required
        def hello_view(request):
            return render(request, self.template_path("hello.html"), {'message': "Hello!"})

        return [
            MountPoint('$', hello_view),
            # more mount points here ...
        ]
    
    def include_js_files(self):
        return ['main.js']
    
    def build_jsx_components(self):
        return ['app.jsx']

    # see also plugin_base.py for more methods
 ```

 * Save the changes and open `app/boot.py`, add an empty line, save the `boot.py`, then remove the empty line, then save `boot.py` again. This is a trick to force WebODM to reload without restarting the docker process. You only need to do this once.
 * Your plugin should be now visible under **Administration** --> **Plugins**.
 * Activate it to see if it works.

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You're now a plugin developer.

Your plugin should have this basic file structure:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ disabled
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json
â”œâ”€â”€ plugin.py
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ app.jsx
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ app.scss
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ main.js
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ webpack.config.js
â””â”€â”€ templates
    â””â”€â”€ hello.html
```

An empty `disabled` file in the root indicates that the plugin should not be enabled by default.

## Django Templates

You can render [Django templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/templates/) (web pages) by placing template files in the `templates` folder. Then you render the templates by creating *mount points* (just like [Django URLs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/http/urls/)).

## Javascript Files

You can execute arbitrary javascript code. When your plugin is enabled, any file returned by `include_js_files` will be included in every WebODM page (in the header). You can use this as your entrypoint for loading more complex Javascript code (e.g. a React build) or for registering a hook.

## CSS Files

Same as for Javascript, you can include arbitrary CSS files via:


```python
def include_css_files(self):
    return ['style.css']
```

## React Components

If you plan to use React (optional) and want to use the built-in system for building the component (also optional), you'll need to declare which `.jsx` files you want to build via:

```python
def build_jsx_components(self):
    return ['app.jsx']
```

The built files will be placed in `coreplugins/my-plugin/public/build/*` and are accessible via `http://localhost:8000/plugins/my-plugin/build/*`.

If you use JSX components, you'll want to restart your development environment with:

```bash
./webodm.sh restart --dev --dev-watch-plugins
```

Otherwise you'll have to manually run `webpack --watch` from the `coreplugins/my-plugin/public` folder (inside the WebODM container).

On the client side, you can import your React components, as well as any other Javascript module, using various hooks. One of such hooks is the `PluginsAPI.App.Ready`, which is triggered on page load:

```javascript
PluginsAPI.App.ready([
        '/plugins/my-plugin/build/app.js',
        '/plugins/my-plugin/build/app.css'        
    ], function(args, App){
    
    ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(App, {greeting: "Hi"}), $("#hello-component").get(0));
});
```
