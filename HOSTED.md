# Hosted Instances

In order to share public links (accessible from anybody on the internet) you need a hosted instance. You can use a commercial service or self-host your own instance.

## Commercial Services

## Self-Host

Pick a cloud service provider (e.g. [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)) and [install WebODM](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM?tab=readme-ov-file#run-it-on-the-cloud-google-compute-amazon-aws). Then import your tasks on the newly created instance in order to share links with others.
