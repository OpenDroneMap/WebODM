# WebODM Trademark Guidelines

WebODM is an open source project and [UAV4GEO](https://uav4geo.com) is the steward of its trademark. Because the code is available to download and modify, proper use of the WebODM trademark is essential to inform users whether or not UAV4GEO stands behind a product or service. When using WebODM trademarks you must comply with these guidelines.

The trademark names include:

 * WebODM
 * WebODM Lightning

The trademark logos include:

 ![WebODM](https://opendronemap.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/webodm-icon-64x64.png)

However, this is not a complete list of names, logos, and brand features, all of which are subject to these guidelines.

## When do I need specific permission to use a WebODM trademark?

You may do the following without receiving specific permission from UAV4GEO:

 * Use WebODM wordmarks in text to truthfully refer to and/or link to unmodified WebODM programs, products, services and technologies.
 * Use WebODM logos in visuals to truthfully refer to and/or to link to the applicable programs, products, services and technologies hosted on UAV4GEO servers.
 * Use WebODM wordmarks to explain that your software is based on WebODM's open source code, or is compatible with WebODM's software.
 * Describe a social media account, page, or community in accordance with the [Social Media Guidelines](#social-media-guidelines).

All other uses of a WebODM trademark require our prior written permission. This includes any use of a WebODM trademark in a domain name. Contact us at https://uav4geo.com/contact for more information.

## When allowed, how should I use a WebODM trademark?

### General Guidelines

#### Do:

 * Use the WebODM trademark exactly as shown in the list above.
 * Use WebODM wordmarks only as an adjective, never as a noun or verb. Do not use them in plural or possessive forms. Instead, use the generic term for the WebODM product or service following the trademark, for example: WebODM processing software.

#### Don't:

 * Don't use WebODM trademarks in the name of your business, product, service, app, domain name, publication, or other offering.
 * Don't use marks, logos, company names, slogans, domain names, or designs that are confusingly similar to WebODM trademarks.
 * Don't use WebODM trademarks in a way that incorrectly implies affiliation with, or sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by UAV4GEO of your products or services.
 * Don't display WebODM trademarks more prominently than your product, service, or company name.
 * Don't use WebODM trademarks on merchandise for sale (e.g., selling t-shirts, mugs, etc.)
 * Don't use WebODM trademarks for any other form of commercial use (e.g. offering technical support services), unless such use is limited to a truthful and descriptive reference (e.g. Independent technical support for WebODM's software).
 * Don't modify WebODM trademarks, abbreviate them, or combine them with any other symbols, words, or images, or incorporate them into a tagline or slogan.

 ### Social Media Guidelines

In addition to the General Guidelines above, the name and handle of your social media account and any and all pages cannot begin with an WebODM trademark. In addition, WebODM logos cannot be used in a way that might suggest affiliation with WebODM, including, but not limited to, the account, profile, or header images. The only exception to these requirements is if you've received prior permission from WebODM.

For example, you cannot name your account, page, or community "WebODM Representatives" or "WebODM Software". However, it would be acceptable to name your account, page, or community "Fans of WebODM" or "Information about WebODM Software" as long as you do not use the WebODM trademarks or WebODM logos or otherwise suggest any affiliation with WebODM.

### Open Source Project Guidelines

WebODM's license and code says what you can and cannot do with the code itself but does not give permission to use WebODM's trademarks. If you choose to build on or modify WebODM's open source code for your own project,

#### You Must:

 * Follow the terms of the Open Source License(s) for WebODM software products and code.
 * Choose branding, logos, and trademarks that denotes your own unique identity so as to clearly signal to users that there is no affiliation with or endorsement by WebODM.
 * Follow the General Guidelines, above.

#### You Must NOT:

* Use any WebODM trademark in connection with the user-facing name or branding of your project.
 * Use any WebODM trademark or any part of any WebODM trademark to incorrectly suggest or give the impression your software is actually published by, affiliated with, or endorsed by WebODM.

For example, please do not name your project, [Something]-WebODM

#### You May:

 * State in words (not using logos or images) that your product "works with" or "is compatible" with WebODM, if that is true.
 * State in words (not using logos or images) that your project is based on WebODM open source technology, if that is true, as long as you also include a statement that your project is not officially associated with WebODM or its products.

For instance, you may state that your project:

"is proudly built from WebODM's open source software"

as long as you also include the statement equally prominently:

"[Brand Name] and [Product Name] are not officially associated with WebODM or its products."

### Cloud-based Services

If you offer a cloud-based service that provides remote access to WebODM software, it is important that you do so in a way that does not confuse users about who is offering the service. You must not use WebODM trademarks in the name of your product or service.

You may state in words (not using logos or images) that your product or service features or provides access to unaltered WebODM software, if this is true.

For example:

Acceptable: [Your Product Name] featuring WebODM's processing software

Incorrect: WebODM [Your Product Name]

### Community Guidelines

Various permissions to use WebODM Trademarks have been provided to various members of the community, and these WebODM Trademark Guidelines do not alter any such previously granted permissions.
